/** config for pwm and signs

The pwm mode is defined as follows :
you can add flags like the ones who follow : 

PWM_NORMAL            : normal pwm, just to put a value if nothing else is needed
PWM_REVERSE           : invert pwm output, not sign

PWM_SIGNED            : activate the sign output on a port (see config)
PWM_SIGN_INVERTED     : invert sign output
PWM_SPECIAL_SIGN_MODE : if defined, the pwm is always near 0 for low values, 
                        else negative low values are near 100%


the values of PWMxx_SIGN_PORT and PWMxx_SIGN_BIT are simply ignored if the PWM is not signed


if you need for example a PWM1A with special sign mode you configure like this : 

#define PWM1A_MODE       (PWM_SIGNED | PWM_SPECIAL_SIGN_MODE)
#define PWM1A_SIGN_PORT  PORTB
#define PWM1A_SIGN_BIT   2

*/



// example for signed pwm1A
#define PWM1A_MODE       (PWM_SIGNED)
#define PWM1A_SIGN_PORT  PORTB
#define PWM1A_SIGN_BIT   2





/** 
PWM synchronization.

this makes the PWMs synchronized.
just activate the timers you want to synchronize

to synch PWMs you need to enshure that the timers have same prescales. This is verified.
you need also to enshure that the PWM mode is the same, this is NOT verified !!
especially, for syncing 8 and 16 bit timers, the PWM mode should be 8 bit.


side effect : on some controllers prescalers are shared, so unwanted prescalers can be reset.

This feature is not 100% shure for the moment, but has been tested on M32 and M128
