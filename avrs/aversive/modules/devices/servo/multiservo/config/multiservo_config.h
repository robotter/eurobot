/* You should specify the config for prescaler
 * It is in TCCRnB for 16 bits timer or in TCCRn for
 * 8 bits timer. See the doc of your AVR device.
 * This is not automatic because it would be too complicated.
 *
 * Example (for timer 3, prescaler 1) :
 * 
 * #define MULTISERVO_TIMER_PRESCALER 1
 * #define MULTISERVO_TIMER_PRESCALER_CONFIG (1 << CS30)
 *
 * Another example (for timer 2, prescaler 32) :
 * 
 * #define MULTISERVO_TIMER_PRESCALER 128
 * #define MULTISERVO_TIMER_PRESCALER_CONFIG ((1 << CS22) | (1 << CS20))
 * 
 * XXX : currently, the user has to choose a good prescaler 
 * value. A good prescaler value is the more precise value 
 * (the highest) that can count during 2 ms.
