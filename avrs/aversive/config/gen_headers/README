These scripts are used to generate aversive_ATxxxxx in aversive/include
directory. If you feel strong enough to try them... ok ;) But keep
in mind that's they are quick'n'dirty scripts, and not written to work
on every machine. They make some assemptions about the atmel website
for documentation downloading... so they could fail tomorrow.

The script expects an 'xml' dir.
